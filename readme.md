# Nicolas Cava Website (Sample Pitch Project)

## 🎯 Project Purpose
This project is a **sample website redesign for Nicolas Cava**, a **Fractional CTO and technical leader** who helps early-stage startups scale their software and teams.  
The website is being created as a **demonstration project** to showcase a modern, high-performing, and strategically designed alternative to his existing site — with the goal of convincing him to purchase a professional website redesign service.

## 🧠 Project Intent for Claude
Claude, please carefully read and follow this intent before coding:

- The website must **reflect the professionalism, clarity, and authority** of a high-end **Fractional CTO**.
- All content, tone, and structure must stay **relevant to startup technology, leadership, product scaling, and technical excellence**.
- Do **not** invent unrelated marketing or lifestyle content (no e-commerce, fashion, travel, or unrelated business niches).
- The design will be guided by the **UI/UX image** provided separately.  
  Focus your code and optimization strictly on implementing the **functional, technical, and strategic** excellence described below.

## ⚙️ Core Objectives
The website should demonstrate mastery in the following areas:

1. **Speed and Performance**  
   - Instant page loads and minimal blocking scripts.  
   - Use of image optimization, lazy loading, and caching.  
   - Proper prefetching and preloading of critical resources.  
   - Lighthouse performance score target: **90+**.

2. **SEO Excellence**  
   - Semantic HTML structure with correct heading hierarchy (`h1`, `h2`, etc.).  
   - Meta tags for `title`, `description`, `canonical`, `og:`, and `twitter:` data.  
   - JSON-LD structured data for **Person** and **Article** types.  
   - Sitemap and robots.txt included.  
   - Clean URL slugs and internal linking for crawlability.  
   - Fast loading, minimal CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift).

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**  
   - Fully optimized for mobile devices and tablets.  
   - Use of fluid typography, responsive spacing, and scalable buttons.  
   - Test visually for breakpoints: 320px, 768px, and 1024px.  
   - Include the viewport meta tag for proper scaling.  
   - Ensure Lighthouse mobile score: **90+**.

   - Semantic tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).  
   - Alt text for all images.  
   - Sufficient color contrast.  
   - Keyboard-navigable interactive elements.  
   - Proper ARIA roles where needed.

5. **Technical Precision**  
   - Use modern best practices for maintainability and scalability.  
   - Modular, reusable components.  
   - Optimize bundle size and avoid unused imports.  
   - Implement clean code structure with meaningful naming.  
   - Use Next.js or another SSR-friendly framework for better SEO.

   - Portray Nicolas as an **authority in technical leadership**.  
   - Messaging should communicate:  
     - Confidence, clarity, and efficiency.  
     - A deep understanding of product and people scaling.  
     - A founder-friendly, trustworthy tone.  
   - Copy should reflect that he works with **early-stage to $5M+ ARR startups**, helping them build **scalable software and resilient teams**.  
   - No salesy buzzwords — use calm, expert, and minimal language.

7. **Thought Leadership Integration**  
   - Include references to “Notes” or blog insights as part of the build (even placeholders).  
   - Make sure blog posts are technically structured for SEO and schema.  
   - The site should feel like a place where Nicolas shares experience, not just sells services.

8. **Social Proof and Trust Cues**  
   - Include sections for testimonials or achievements (can be placeholders).  
   - Space for linking to LinkedIn and X (Twitter).  
   - Optional: structured data for “Review” if testimonials are implemented.

9. **Performance Optimizations**  
   - Image formats: **WebP/AVIF**.  
   - Lazy load non-critical content.  
   - Preload hero image and fonts.  
   - Compress scripts and remove render-blocking code.  
   - Lighthouse “Best Practices” target: **100%**.

10. **Deployment and Scalability**  
    - Ready for deployment on **Vercel** or any modern edge-hosted platform.
